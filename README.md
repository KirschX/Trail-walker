1. Time Spent:
   Approximately 17 hours.

2. Suggested Improvements:

- Clean code and architecture: Given more time, I would have refined the code and improved the architecture. I would manage state entirely using a frontend data layer, possibly with tools like Redux or Zustand.

- Framework Selection for Complex SPA: For developing a more intricate Single Page Application (SPA), I would consider utilizing a different set of frameworks, libraries, and CSS tools. For instance, while next.js and tailwindcss are valuable tools, they might not be the best choices for a fully dynamic SPA. Additionally, integrating front-end state management solutions such as Redux or Zustand, along with server-state management tools like Tanstack Query, would ensure more stringent and robust state management.

- Error & Loading Handling: I would have used React Suspense for more declarative programming to manage error boundaries and loading states.

- Cross-browser Compatibility: Would have ensured that the application has been tested and optimized across various browsers for consistent user experience such.

- Enhanced Google Street View Features: Would have considered integrating additional capabilities provided by Google Street View to make the application more interactive and informative.

- Unit testing: I would aim for 100% coverage to ensure every aspect of the application is tested thoroughly.
